I support engineering teams to grow and become very high performing and effective by fostering psychological safety and engineering best practices. I prefer to work in a high trust, highly autonomous environment so that I can lead my team in iteratively improving that process to make it faster, safer, and more sustainable. I'm seeking to grow or support a trusting and collaborative culture where we can all do our best engineering work.

EMPLOYMENT ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff Software Engineer, Influxdata (2023-03 — Present)
Influxdata is the company behind InfluxDB, a leading time series database for sensors, metrics, and IoT workloads. I've built and supported internal dev tools and CI/CD infrastructure. I've also supported the development, packaging, deployment, and operations of the on-prem and hosted single-tenant database products.
- Took over and maintained the pre-existing universal CICD pipeline, which served almost all teams and products
- Refactored and migrated multiple products to their own CICD pipelines, which greatly reduced deployment risk and cross-team deadlocks
- Maintained and enhanced the large jsonnet-based IAC ecosystem used to manage k8s deployment for all cloud hosted products
- Developed the build and packaging pipelines for the on-prem product
- Configured kube-prometheus monitoring and alerts
- Participated in on-call rotations and customer support escalation

Staff Software Engineer, DevOps, Screencastify (2022-05 — 2023-01)
Screencastify makes a screen recording application that's popular in k12 education. I joined to grow DevOps practices and culture within the engineering organization, and I think I've been very successful in doing so. This has been a great team and a great experience, where I've been able to put into practice many aspects of a DevOps working model that have been mostly theoretical for me in the past.
- Improved speed and reliability of the CICD pipeline by about 30% and 60% respectively, to a median run time less than 15 minutes
- Drove observability efforts, including distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Led incident response and retrospectives, with a blame-aware process focussed on building team confidence to participate in future incident response
- Technical lead for the DevOps team, coordinating both planned projects and interrupt-driven work, and building cross functional expertise within the team and department

Staff Software Engineer, Instil (2021-09 — 2022-03)
Instil is an early-stage startup that unfortunately did not have the product-market fit they thought they did when I joined. I tried to promote sustainable and effective development practices to support the team. At the same time, I also developed multiple significant features for their CRM product. But ultimately the unpredictability of searching for a market fit wasn't a good situation for me.
- Developed major features for the Instil CRM app, notably an audit log, data export, and 3rd party integration framework
- Enhanced unit tests and decoupled a majority of tests from dependency on DynamoDB
- Drove a reliability initiative, including early efforts at defining Service Level Objectives
- Worked to define and codify architectural practices already in use, and provide guidance on future development

Senior Software Engineer, Charles Schwab (2019-08 — 2021-08)
I joined Schwab as the technical lead for a development team in the Retail Web Technology group. I worked on multiple projects, including a greenfield customer-facing cash transfer app. On that and other projects, I worked closely with designers and product owners and other development teams working in parallel to build backend services and mobile features.
- Maintained high standards of quality and code coverage.
- Developed customer facing single page apps in Angular 7 and 9.
- Developed middle-tier APIs in C#/.Net Core using Web API.

- Worked with multiple stakeholders in an agile process to scope and estimate new features, improve production operations, and maintain a predictable velocity.

Senior Software Engineer, Solera/Title Tech (2018-10 — 2019-08)
At Solera, I worked on customer facing products dealing with state and local laws, taxes, and fees related to vehicle sales, registration, and titling. I advocated for greater adoption of engineering best practices, especially surrounding continuous testing and deployment. I also coordinated with other teams in designing new service oriented architectures.
- Drove improvements in the development process and adoption of best practices, especially code review and unit testing.
- Worked on a data normalization effort to enable major code refactoring to reduce duplication.
- Collaborated across multiple teams to define common conventions and interfaces for REST microservices.
- Implemented intake and cleanup utilities for 3rd party data.

Senior Software Engineer, Allegro Development (2017-11 — 2018-09)
At Allegro I led an overseas team in designing and building new features for Allegro's main product, Horizon. I also pushed to advance best practices including unit testing and DevOps.
- Designed and implemented scripting and automation features in the application. These were used by external clients to ensure data integrity and internally by QA and client services during customer onboarding.
- Mentored junior developers on design principles and best practices.
- Improved the packaging and deployment process for development builds to remove manual operations and support CI/CD efforts.

Senior Software Engineer, ParkHub (2017-03 — 2017-09)
At Parkhub, I built a new generation of services and infrastructure for a sensor-based parking lot monitoring service. I utilized IoT sensors, containerized microservices, and Kubernetes.
- Designed and built a charting API to transform sensor based parking event data into a format that's easily visualized in graphs or charts.
- Contributed to the design and development of a microservices architecture based on Kafka and orchestrated with Kubernetes.
- Developed front end apps, primarily using React and Redux.
- Conducted code reviews and advocated for best practices related to testing and deployment.

Senior Software Engineer, Fidelity Investments (2014-06 — 2017-03)
As a software engineer, led multiple very successful automated testing efforts. I also played a central role in the design and implementation of customer facing and middle tier applications. I promoted best practices and mentored junior team members throughout these projects.
- Designed and implemented multiple projects including a customer facing apps and middleware services; provided ongoing development and support after release.
- Maintained greater than 90% test coverage for these projects.
- Worked closely with Product Owner in Scrum process to clarify requirements and adapt them to user stories.

PROJECTS -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Letterbook, Maintainer (open source) (??? — Present)
Letterbook is a federated microblogging service, implementing ActivityPub. The goal for the project is to make hosting a fediverse server a better and more sustainable experience. We also want to make it a safer and more inclusive space for the people who make the fediverse their social media home.
I began Letterbook in the 2nd half of 2023 as an alternative to Mastodon and other federated social media apps, with a focus on low cost, easy operations, and an inviting stance for other contributors. It's grown to have 5 or 6 semi-regular contributors and is nearing an alpha release. As the project creator and core maintainer, I've done the large majority of the technical work, of course. Beyond that, I've focussed on recruiting, on-boarding, and coordinating other contributors to create a long-term collaborative project.
- Federated microblogging platform, similar to Mastodon or Bluesky
- Flexible architecture to support, small single server deployments that can grow as-needed to high-capacity, high-availability, distributed systems
- Emphasis on observability, to enable independent admins to understand and manage their own software, and to better investigate problems when they arise
- Small but growing community of contributors
- Admins and moderators are a first-class priority
- Optimizing for performance on low cost, low powered hardware and global mobile networks and devices; targeting world-wide accessibility

Castify Studio, DevOps (professional) (??? — Present)
The new Castify Studio product is a 2nd generation of Screencastify's core screen-recording app. This evolves the product from a standalone application into a complete service, which provides a much better experience for the basic record/edit/share workflow, and will enable the company to support a much richer set of features going forward.
I led the DevOps and SRE effort in the lead up to release and beyond. In my time here, I shifted the DevOps team away from a purely reactive catchall group doing infrastructure toil, to one that actively makes improvements to the workflows and process of the whole engineering organization. I put heavy emphasis on reliability, the developer experience including speed and reliability of CICD, the observability of our systems, and ease and safety of deployment.
- Containerized architecture in GCP
- Mix of client-server request-response work, and dynamically scaled asynchronous processing mediated through a task queue in kubernetes
- Emphasis on observability; logs, metrics, traces, with the goal of making system behavior understandable and discoverable
- Docker compose based local development workflow, including traces and log collection
- Feature flags; enabling more rapid and controlled deployments, and as a tool to support operations, customer success, and product decision
- Blame-aware incident response and retrospectives focussed on building team confidence to participate in future incident response
