# About Me

I'm a full stack software engineer. I work mostly in C# and Javascript, and I'm more than comfortable working with SQL and Mongo. I've worked extensively in web and desktop apps. I strive to create consistent and repeatable results, and I do so through advocating for teams to adopt robust testing, review, and design practices. I believe that the best teams operate with a culture of quality and ownership over their work.
